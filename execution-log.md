## Phase 0: Environment Setup
- 2026-02-25T05:31:21Z Working folder structure created
- 2026-02-25T05:31:21Z Python 3.10.12 verified
- 2026-02-25T05:31:21Z Packages installed: python-docx, requests, pandas (streamlit has contextvars issue in sandbox but app.py will be generated for local use)
- 2026-02-25T05:31:21Z Decision: Streamlit cannot run in this sandbox environment due to missing contextvars stdlib module. Will generate app.py for user to run locally.
